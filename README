My faithful user,
	Thanks for downloading this code! Credit goes to the writers of the wiki for the descriptions I've used. MLP:FiM itself belongs to Hasbro and Lauren Faust.
That's that out of the way. This is just code, no GUI yet as I don't know how, but make sure to execute it through Python 3.3 IDLE.
